Sentiment analyzer
We made this project- sentiment analyzer during a 16-hour long hackathon. This project can predict the sentiments depicted in a given piece of text. We have done this using NLP-Natural language processing and its really fun how accurately this little piece of code can analyze the sentiments of such complex beings like us!!
